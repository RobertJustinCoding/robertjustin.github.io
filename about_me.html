				<li><h1 class = "medescription"> Annyeong! I'm Robert Justin Espinar, a current G9 student from PSHS-CRC. I love doing things with definite endings, even if it is lengthy; for example, solving Mathematical problems and writing books. I started writing books as a leisure activity during 7th grade since everything during that time was often virtually done. Needless to say, I named it RJ Writings as it pertains to the initials of my first name. My original plan was to create a website about The Spike game, but I decided to change it last minute and thought of a platform where I could showcase my writings instead. Another reason why I decided to create a virtual library is because of its vast inclusivity; considering the current composition styles present in my website, compared to the total number of composition styles, would make my website extremely minute.</h1>
